# Converse

Discord bot for anonymously chatting on discord.

## How it works

When you start chatting with the bot, by sending it `++start` it will start looking for someone to connect with you.
Upon connecting, any messages you send to the bot will be forwarded to the other person.
The chat is kept open indefinitely, until you close it by sending `++stop`.
